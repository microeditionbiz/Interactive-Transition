I created this project in order to replicate the behaviour that you can find on Snapchat when you pull down to access Profile screen.

I started to work on this, but then I realised that I can't implement this transition with Interactive Transitions because the profile screen has a transparent background, furthermore the button with a white circle is shared across the two screens.

You can find the right implementation here: [Custom Transition](https://github.com/microeditionbiz/Custom-Transition.git  "Custom Transition")

Even though it doesn't reproduce Snapchat's behaviour, I decided to upload this project because it's a good example of Interactive Transitions.


This is how the transition looks in this project:
